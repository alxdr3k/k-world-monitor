# Current Implementation Docs

These docs help humans and AI agents understand the implemented state quickly.

They are thin navigation docs.

They do not replace code, tests, migrations, or generated schema.

They also do not own roadmap / status inventory. Use
`docs/04_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for milestone, track, phase, slice, gate,
evidence, and next-work tracking.

Files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CODE_MAP.md` | where code lives |
| `DATA_MODEL.md` | current schema/model map |
| `RUNTIME.md` | actual request/event flow |
| `TESTING.md` | validation commands and CI check mapping |
| `OPERATIONS.md` | local run/env/debug/deploy/CD notes |

CI/CD design guidance lives in `../11_CI_CD.md`. Keep actual commands in
`TESTING.md`, and keep actual deployment procedures in `OPERATIONS.md` and
`../05_RUNBOOK.md`.
